# Open Learning Read

`Read` is a light-weight web application for consuming [`git4ol` published](//github.com/open-learning/git4ol/blob/master/publishing.md) lessons.


## Summary

Sometimes all you need is a web-based, read-only dirt-simple interface for consuming [`git4ol`](//github.com/open-learning/git4ol) lessons.

If you:

- Host your lessons from your `git` repository (like [GitHub pages](//pages.github.com/)
- Publish your lessons as described in [`git4ol` publishing](//github.com/open-learning/git4ol/blob/master/publishing.md)
- Don't need support for challenges

Then `read` may be the application for you.
